## Abstract

ABCDDNA is a theme specific extension for ABCD (Access to Biological Collections Data) created to facilitate storage and exchange of data related to DNA collection units, such as DNA extraction specifics, DNA quality parameters, and data characterising products of downstream applications, along with the relation to the analysed voucher specimen. ABCDDNA is an XML Schema extension to ABCD 2.06, which offers only a rudimentary set of DNA-specific data ("Sequences").

This document specifies the DNA extension for ABCD 2.06.

ABCDDNA is a product of the DNA Bank Network. More details about the ABCDDNA schema as well as tools to implement and support ABCDDNA are available at "IT Tools and Manuals" http://www.dnabank-network.org/Downloads.php
